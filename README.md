Simple day planner for a 9-5 schedule. 

Assuming this application is used between 9am and 5pm, hour blocks are colored as followed:
PAST is gray,
CURRENT is red,
FUTURE is green.

If it's past 5pm, all blocks will be gray until the next day. To test functionality outside of 9-5, just change your pc's time.
